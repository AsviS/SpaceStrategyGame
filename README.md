# SpaceStrategyGame
A space strategy game(potentially vr aswell)
Description:
Space game
Premise:
A multiple open world ongoing(Non-match-based) strategy game. 
Settings:
Space, aliens/space empires/alliances. 
Futuristic: spaceships, lasers, special weapons(teleportation, etc.)
Rules and game format:
Begin with a ship, start exploring, gain resources/capital($) by finding treasures per hour and or harvesting material from empty planets.
Fight wars and rob enemy spaceships. Or
Add friends and or make/join alliances. Or
Alliances will allow players to automatically work together, defending each other and attacking others together. Also fund a mutual alliance army.
Trade with other players (Not safe because they may betray and fight) or
Trade with many players in trade centers owned by other players. Certified with Contract that guarantees all players will not be able to enter and trade with weapons, otherwise they’d be shot down by the owner player’s army automatically. 
Find an empty planet and inhabit it. (Costs resources and $)
Once one owns a planet, make more ships (having a base at the planet)
Declare war and or attack/defend from other players and their planets/ship/flee. 
Make trade center if you have enough resources, this will give you tarrifs and percentage of all trades done there.
Resources include fuel, building materials for ships/buildings, special rare materials used for building special things or making special weapons. 
Inhabit other planets, thus making an empire.
Conquer other players’ planets (thus robbing them/stealing from their exports/imports)  
This has a limited time possibilities before you become “wanted” thus making other players get $ for stopping you, paid by the intergalactic senate:
An organization all players are offered to join as soon as they own a planet, costs very little per hour, protects from conquerors that don’t leave after a certain time limit.
Players may pay some money to get some advantages in game, for example teleport instead of slow travel and/or get speed buildings by galactic workers.
Game play:
First, only 2d, pictures on screens and basic animation, battles done by clicking on where the ship should shoot, if offline battle automatically played averagely. 
Then, 3d +/ VR, use a VR set control ship/ see universe from FPS perspective control panel for battles, potentially even hold weapon in hand and shoot when breaking into an enemy ship.
